    "It would be nice to mention the disadvantages of a Library vs a Framework too. You mentioned 'Being able to choose the libraries that you prefer as an advantage', I agree but it is an advantage only when you are experienced enough. Having to choose libraries is difficult when you're a beginner."

It’s simple, eye-catching, light and user-friendly. It’s already been around for a couple of years, but thanks to constant updates, it hasn’t lost its popularity."

    "Era una ciudad de plástico, de esas que no quiero ver. De edificios cancerosos, y un corazón de oropel. Donde en vez de un sol amanece un dólar. Donde nadie ríe, donde nadie llora. Con gente de rostros de poliéster; que escuchan sin oír y miran sin ver. Gente que vendió por comodidad, su razón de ser y su libertad..."

    "He was crazy enough, he was foolish, he was hungry, he was original, he did it. His best wins happened when nobody could think of seeing him won. That's what made him different. When he was not able to beat Liston, Frazier, Norton, Foreman, he followed his heart. He showed us your heart has many things to say, and fear is just a delusion, He made it. What an incredible man..."
